# Green & Tasty Restaurant Management Application

## Overview

The **Green & Tasty Restaurant Management Application** is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline operations, reservation management, and customer interaction across the "Green & Tasty" network of restaurants. This system supports three restaurant locations, each housing between 10 to 20 tables with varying seating capacities (maximum of 10 seats per table).

Each month, restaurant managers generate a critical report called the **"Green T Report"**, which tracks vital metrics such as menu popularity, customer attendance, and staff performance. The application simplifies the collection and analysis of this data, thus enhancing day-to-day operations and strategic planning.
